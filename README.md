#First Version of Prop Hunt for UT! # 
##########################

Two teams, hunters versus hiders. Hunters need to persue hider players disguised as props though every miss
with the hunter weapon is a health penalty, so make sure you shoot wisely! As hunters there is only one way to 
win the round - find and kill all the hiders before the round time is over. Hiders have a couple ways to win a round
for their team, first is having at least one hider alive when the round is over and second is having the hunters all
die by them missing their shots and being trigger happy. Though, hiders have a disadvantge, when standing still
for a while, their health slowly reduces. Hiders must use their surroundings to blend into the environment and
avoid the hunters to stay alive! At the end of every round, teams switch sides to take turns being hiders and hunters.
Stay hidden or die trying!

Configurable Variables:
HunterHealth - How much health hunters start with, keep in mind that for each kill a hunter gets, they gain a third this amount for every kill. default=200
HiderHealth - How much health the hiders have to start, recommend keeping this around default. default=50
RoundTime - Length in minutes for each round ( not including Hide Time ). default=2
RoundsToWin - The team goal to get to for their team to win the game. default=7
